I am an MSc student of Artificial Intelligence at the [School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Queen Mary University of London](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/). My MSc specialises on Computer Vision and Robotics. 

My research interests span Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, and Control Engineering applied to robotic systems. I aim to build robots with flexibly perform daunting tasks with little world knowledge.

I am open to learning and collaborating on any exciting project :).
